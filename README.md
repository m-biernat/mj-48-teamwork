## About

Splash It! is a **local co-op arcade** game made in **~48h** during [Mini Jam 48: Teamwork](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-48-teamwork). The main goal is to **collect** as many **coins** as you can by moving **the boat** in the bathtub. The players **control** two characters, the duck on the left and the frog on the right. A character can **move** up and down, as well as **jump** to make **a splash**. The wave caused by jumping **moves** the boat. The players have to avoid the whirl that **spawns** in the different parts of the bathtub. The game ends when the boat **gets sucked into** the whirl.
